# Sequence Diagram Translator #

This program serves to translate xml-formatted sequence diagrams into NuSMV-compatible LTL specifications.

### Notes ###
* A python-based parser exists in the jython subdirectory for translating sequence diagrams made in Eclipse's Papyrus plugin to xml.
* This program is a re-write of an existing program by Hui Shen in order to fix bugs and improve general performance. All template formulas were derived by Hui Shen, Jianwei Niu, and Ram Krishnan.
* Currently, this program is being written and is not yet completely functional.
